### This chapter described the case of the student Jesse Jordan of RPI. Jesse simply implemented a search engine algorithm from microsoft on the RPI network. As people were putting music on their public folders, it was more easily findable on the search engine. The music industry filed a lawsuit stating that because he made the music more easily findable, he is liable for piracy. This showed me that when I design software I have to keep in mind several things. One such thing is that there may be unintended consequenses of my work. This should be supplanted with the use of licenses or other legal means to direct negative consequenses away from me, the creator of the software. Another such thing is to advise users on how their actions affect the system as a whole, it may have been the case that many users weren't aware that their public folder is accessible to anyone, or that sharing copyrighted media there is illegal

### The main way I am looking for open source projects are through github's explore page. Through there, I can find repositories that github recomends to me that are open source. For example, some of the interesting open source repositories included software to run on pinball machines, tensorflow, machine learning software for .net frameworks, and an MMORPG server. I have to explore these projects more in depth to determine which projects would benefit for my level of experience. However, currently the most interesting seems to be the software that runs on pinball machines.
