# Why put a license?
It is important to add a license to your work to prevent others from misusing it incorrectly. For example, if you have a piece of work that you plan to sell, or monetize in some way, by putting no license on it, you have no legal grounds if someone takes your work and monetizes it before you. 

# Why only use works with an explicit license?
It is possible that the owner of the work updates it and adds a license that contradicts your current use of the work. If you are still unaware of the update, and you continue to use the work in a manner that opposes the license, you can get in legal trouble. 

# The Web and Gopher
I believe because Gopher was straddling the line of open-source and proprietary, they fell lower than they could have if they went all in on either direction. Because Gopher added some proprietary features, such as charging .com users, they fell out of favor with the Open Source community. However, because they were partly open-source, they were able to be forked, which created competition with the developers they recently lost favor of. If they were completely open-source, they would have kept the favor of the community, and if they were completely proprietary, they wouldn't have had to worry about being forked.

# Linux and GPL-2
According to this <a rel = "source" href = "https://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvaldss-love-hate-relationship-with-the-gpl/">source</a> the main purpose of linux using a GPL-2 license is to strengthen the community and prevent fragmentation. One big advantage that the GPL has is that it prevents sublicensing, which prevents any developers from releasing a modified linux under a different license. In addition, it must accredit the original and state any changes, which together discourages forking and the fragmentation of the Linux community.
